## 1️⃣ Reflection (5 points)

### What was the most challenging part of the workflow? Why?

The **most challenging part** was designing the preprocessing pipeline and ensuring data cleaning aligned with the problem's goals. Handling missing data systematically while avoiding information leakage requires careful planning and understanding of the data context.

Another challenge was **balancing model interpretability with performance** since healthcare projects require transparent models, while some high-performance models are black boxes.

### How would you improve your approach with more time/resources?

✅ I would explore **advanced feature engineering** techniques, including medical domain insights, to improve model performance.  
✅ I would implement **automated hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Optuna)** to optimize models efficiently.  
✅ I would set up **continuous integration and monitoring pipelines** to automatically detect concept drift and retrain the model as needed.
